<h1>The Best Movies according to me</h1>

<h2>The Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>The hype that this movie created was insane. It cumulated the 10yrs of MCU as well</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>My first Imax movie. Also the amazing cast with the likes of cillian murphy and RDJ </p>
<h3>Spider-man : no way home</h3>
<p>the insane hype and suspense of 3 spider-men in a same movie </p>
